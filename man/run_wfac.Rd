\title{Run a Weighted Flow Accumulation (WFAC) algorithm for a subbasin-streamflow raster}
\usage{
run_wfac(FlowDir, Qmodel, Shapefile, nSub, t)
}
\arguments{
\item{FlowDir}{Flow direction raster in GRASS format (directions from 1 to 8).}

\item{Qmodel}{Subbasin-streamflow raster. Q values only at sub-basin centroids cells.}

\item{Shapefile}{Subbasins shapefile.}

\item{nSub}{Numbers of subbasin to be processed.}

\item{t}{Timestep (for an iterative mode).}
}
\value{
[Qsub] Streamflow values at the oulet of each subbasin. [Qacum] Flow accumulation raster.
